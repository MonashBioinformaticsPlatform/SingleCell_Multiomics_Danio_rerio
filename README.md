#  Single-Cell Multiomics in *Danio rerio* Embryonic Development

This repository contains the code and resources used in the analysis of single-cell multiomic (scRNA-seq + scATAC-seq) data from *Danio rerio* (zebrafish) embryos collected at three developmental stages: day 2, day 4, and day 6 post-fertilization. The project applies the SCENIC+ framework to reconstruct transcriptional regulatory networks and identify cell-type-specific regulons across early development.
